* **Authenticator Apps**: Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, etc. (TOTP standard)
* **Recovery Codes**: Emergency backup codes for account recovery
* **Custom Providers**: SMS, Passkey, and other extensions available

= Can users enable multiple 2FA methods? =
Yes! Users can enable multiple providers for redundancy. For example, they can use both Telegram and Email, so if one method is unavailable, they can use the other.

= How do I create custom 2FA providers? =
AuthPress features an extensible architecture. Check the developer documentation at [AuthPress Custom Providers Developer Guide](https://authpress.dev/providers/custom-providers-developer-guide) in the plugin directory for complete instructions on creating custom providers.

= Is AuthPress compatible with my authenticator app? =
Yes, AuthPress uses the standard TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) protocol, which is compatible with all major authenticator apps including Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, 1Password, Bitwarden, and KeePass.

= Can I customize the logo on the "AuthPress" login screen? =
Yes, you can customize the logo using the <code>authpress_logo</code> filter hook. Add this code to your theme's functions.php or a custom plugin:

<code>
// Custom logo on "AuthPress" login screen:
function custom_authpress_logo(){
  $image_path = home_url('/images/');
  $image_filename = 'custom-two-factor-telegram.png';
  return $image_path . $image_filename;
}
add_filter('authpress_logo', 'custom_authpress_logo');
</code>

= What happens if I lose access to all my 2FA methods? =
AuthPress provides recovery codes - single-use backup codes that can be used when your primary 2FA methods are unavailable. Store these codes securely offline when you generate them.

= Can administrators manage users' 2FA settings? =
Yes, administrators can view user 2FA status, disable 2FA for specific users if needed, and monitor all authentication activities through the advanced logging system.
